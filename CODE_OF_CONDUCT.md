# Microcks Community Code of Conduct

Microcks project adheres to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md), aligning with the values of collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity that define open source.

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of the Microcks project, we are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment. By participating in our community, we pledge to:

- Promote a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
- Support a spirit of mutual respect, empathy, and cooperation, ensuring that every contribution—big or small—is valued.
- Encourage collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and continuous learning, as these are the cornerstones of any successful open-source community.

## Our Standards

To ensure a productive, positive experience for all community members, we ask everyone to:

- **Be respectful and considerate**: Engage with others constructively, appreciating the diverse perspectives and ideas within the community.
- **Be collaborative**: Open-source thrives on shared efforts and diverse input. Offer help where needed and seek help when necessary.
- **Lead by example**: Encourage new contributors and foster an environment where everyone feels welcome to participate.
- **Value inclusivity**: Open source is for everyone. Actively support a diverse range of contributors and voices, regardless of background.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior—including harassment, abusive language, or any other forms of misconduct—should be reported to the Microcks project team at **info@microcks.io**.

The project team will:
- Review and investigate all reports confidentially.
- Take action deemed appropriate for the situation, including potential temporary or permanent bans from the community.
- Keep the identity of the reporter confidential, ensuring a safe and respectful process for all involved.

## A Community-Driven Open Source

Microcks thrives because of its open-source community. We encourage all members to actively contribute, share knowledge, and help make our project better for everyone. By following this Code of Conduct, we can create a community that supports innovation, collaboration, and the open-source values we all believe in.
